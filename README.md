# ELM - OpenBadges v3 Mapper

## Overview
This project is a [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)-based application that converts JSON files written in the [OpenBadges v3](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/ob/v3p0) standard to the [ELM](https://europass.europa.eu/en/node/2128) standard and vice versa. The application utilizes the [ratatui](https://ratatui.rs/) and the [crossterm](https://docs.rs/crossterm/latest/crossterm/) library to create the terminal user interface in which the mappings can be completed.

## Features
- Bidirectional conversion between OpenBadges v3 and ELM. Extendable to any standard defined in JsonSchema.
- Interactive Terminal Interface: select your input files and output paths, complete mappings and transformations.
- Support for custom mapping files: the program allows you to save all your mappings to a custom mapping file for future use.
- Forward compatibility with DESM: In the future, DESM will provide professionally curated mapping files which will be shipped as default with the program.

## Installation

cargo run
```
## Usage

The link below contains a youtube video which is a walkthrough of the program.

For a written walkthrough, including screenshots, and explanation on the keyboard and mouse usage read below.

### Page 1, setting program arguments
Upon starting the application, you'll be presented with a terminal interface to select the input file, mapping file, and output file paths. Yellow highlights the active field. Green indicates a valid path. Orange means a given output path will wipe and overwrite an existing file in that location. Red means it's invalid, which disables you from continuing to the next page.
On the bottom you'll find a bar explaining the basic keys as well.

#### Default example files and logging
`res/elm_example.json`: Example input file for ELM standard.  
`res/mapping_empty.json`: An empty mapping file, useful for testing custom mappings.  
`res/output_credential.json`: Example output file for the converted JSON.  
`res/custom_mapping.json`: Example custom mapping file.  

Logs are kept in `logging_folder/impierce-mapper.log`. This file is overwritten upon each startup of the program.

To remove the default file paths remove lines 34 - 38 from the `main.rs`:
```sh
        // Default example values, remove if no longer needed
        input_path: "res/elm_example.json".to_string(),
        mapping_path: "res/mapping_empty.json".to_string(),
        output_path: "res/output_credential.json".to_string(),
        custom_mapping_path: "res/custom_mapping.json".to_string(),
```

#### Keyboard & mouse layout
Use the up and down arrows or tab and F2 to navigate between prompts.  
The left and right arrows enable you the choose within the prompts with tabbers.  
The normal keyboard layout can be used for entering file paths.  
All values are saved automatically.  
Enter can still be used as well to complete a prompt and to move to the next prompt.  
Clicking the complete button in the top right or enter on the last prompt will move you to the next page.  
Esc will prompt you to exit the program, losing all progress.

### Page 2, complete mandatory output fields
Page 2 is focused on the output file. Every standard has a minimum set of mandatory fields which need to be completed in order to render a valid Json file. These mandatory fields are listed on the right. The fields from the input file are listed on the left. Fields on both sides which have been mapped already will appear green. On the bottom you will find the mapping bar, containing all mapping options.  

`DirectCopy` does a direct copy from the selected input value to the selected output result-value (both yellow).
`Transformations` takes you to a new mapping bar allowing you to choose from multiple transformation options. `Lowercase` and `Uppercase` will transform the input value as such. Chosen transformations will be shown on the right of the mapping bar, where they can be deleted from as well.  
*Currently `Slice`, `Regex`, `ManytoOne` and `OnetoMany` are not functional yet*.  

The View button allows you to view the selected fields in full length in a popup, as the main page will truncate long texts. The tabs in the popup are scrollable. Transformations will also be displayed immediately. Navigation on the main page is still possible when the popup is open
The Clear button will close either the popup first if this is open. Then, it will clear all selected mapping options. Finally, if there is no popup nor mapping options selected, it will clear the result-value from the selected output field.
The complete button in the top right will move you to the next page. If not all fields on the right are green, this will render a popup warning informing you the output file will be invalid.

#### Keyboard & mouse layout
Use the arrows, tab and F2 to navigate inside and between tabs.  
Enter will select a field/transformation/button, sometimes moving you to the next tab.  
The complete button, view button and clear button are also clickable.  
Esc works similar as the clear button as it closes the popup if open or clears the mapping options if selected. If none are selected and the popup is closed, it will prompt to exit the program as usual.

### Page 3, completing optional fields
Page 3 is completely optional, the mandatory part is finished in page 2.
In this page you can choose to complete optional output fields.
The layout and usage are the same as page 2.

On the right are now the optional output fields.  
*Currently the optional fields aren't loaded correctly yet, what is visible is dummy data.*  
On the left are the same fields from the input file with the used fields still in green.
This doesn't mean you can't use them again.

#### Keyboard & mouse layout
Use the arrows, tab and F2 to navigate inside and between tabs.  
Enter will select a field/transformation/button, sometimes moving you to the next tab.  
The complete button, view button and clear button are also clickable.  
Esc works similar as the clear button as it closes the popup if open or clears the mapping options if selected. If none are selected and the popup is closed, it will prompt to exit the program as usual.

### Page 4, finished
You are finished, the mapping is done.
This page only displays the output paths where you will find the results of your mapping.
You can safely close the program using either Esc or clicking Complete.
